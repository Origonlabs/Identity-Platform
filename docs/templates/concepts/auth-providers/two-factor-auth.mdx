title: "Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)"
---

This guide explains how Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) works with Atlas Identity Platform. 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a verification code in addition to their password.

<Info>
Atlas Identity Platform implements TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) for two-factor authentication, which is compatible with standard authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, and Authy. 2FA is enabled by default at the platform level and can be configured by individual users.

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### No Developer Configuration Required
  
  2FA is enabled by default on the Atlas Identity Platform platform. Unlike other authentication methods, you don't need to enable it specifically for your project.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### Implement User Settings in Your Application
  
  To allow your users to set up 2FA for their accounts:
  
  1. Make sure you've installed the Atlas Identity Platform SDK in your application:
     ```bash
     npm install @opendex/stack
     ```

  2. Use the Atlas Identity Platform components to give users access to their account settings, where they can enable 2FA:
  
     ```jsx
     import { AccountSettings } from "@opendex/stack";
     
     export default function SettingsPage() {
       return <AccountSettings />;
     }
     ```

  3. The built-in Atlas Identity Platform components will handle the entire 2FA setup process, including QR code generation, verification, and recovery codes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Atlas Identity Platform 2FA Works

Atlas Identity Platform uses the industry-standard TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) algorithm for two-factor authentication:

1. **User Setup**: When a user enables 2FA in their account settings, Atlas Identity Platform generates a secret key that is shared with the user's authenticator app (usually via a QR code).

2. **Code Generation**: The authenticator app generates a 6-digit code that changes every 30 seconds, based on the shared secret and the current time.

## Recommended Authenticator Apps

The following authenticator apps are compatible with Atlas Identity Platform 2FA:

- Google Authenticator (Android, iOS)
- Microsoft Authenticator (Android, iOS)
- Authy (Android, iOS, desktop)
- 1Password (Android, iOS, desktop)
- LastPass Authenticator (Android, iOS)
