This guide explains how to set up Passkey authentication with Atlas Identity Platform. Passkeys allow users to sign in to your application securely using biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys.

<Info>
Passkeys provide a more secure and convenient authentication method compared to traditional passwords by using WebAuthn standard.

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### Enable Passkey Authentication in Atlas Identity Platform
  
  1. Log in to the [Atlas Identity Platform dashboard](https://dashboard.opendex.com/).
  2. Select your project from the dashboard.
  3. In the left sidebar, select **Auth Methods**.
  4. Find the **Passkey** authentication method and toggle it to enable.
  5. Save your changes.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### Implement Passkey Authentication in Your Application
  
  1. Make sure you've installed the Atlas Identity Platform SDK in your application:
     ```bash
     npm install @stackframe/stack
     ```

  2. Add Passkey support to your sign-in component by using the built-in Atlas Identity Platform components or creating your own implementation with the SDK.
     
     Using built-in components:
     ```jsx
     import { SignIn } from "@stackframe/stack";
     
     export default function SignInPage() {
       return <SignIn />;
     }
     ```
           
     The built-in components will automatically show the passkey option when it's enabled in your project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Passkey Authentication Works

1. **Registration**: When a user creates a new passkey, their device generates a unique public-private key pair. The private key stays on the user's device, while the public key is sent to Atlas Identity Platform's servers.

2. **Authentication**: When a user wants to sign in, Atlas Identity Platform sends a challenge to the user's device. The device uses the private key to sign the challenge, and sends the signature back to Atlas Identity Platform for verification.

3. **Cross-device authentication**: Users can create passkeys on one device and use them to sign in on another device using QR codes or nearby device detection.
