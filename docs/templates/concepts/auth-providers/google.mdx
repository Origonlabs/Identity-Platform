This guide explains how to set up Google as an authentication provider with Atlas Identity Platform. Google OAuth2 allows users to sign in to your application using their Google account.

<Info>
For Development purposes, Atlas Identity Platform uses shared keys for this provider. Shared keys are automatically created by Stack, but show Stack's logo on the OAuth sign-in page.
You should replace these before you go into production.
