## Product
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do you compare to `<X>`?">
    Ask yourself about `<X>`:

    - Does `<X>` have transparent licensing and predictable pricing?
    - Is `<X>` developer-friendly, well-documented, and lets you get started in minutes?
    - Besides authentication, does `<X>` also do authorization and user management (see feature list below)?
    
    If you answered "no" to any of these questions, then that's how Atlas Identity Platform is different from `<X>`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I migrate my existing userbase to Atlas Identity Platform?">
    Yes! You can [create users programmatically](/rest-api/server/users/create-user) using our [REST API](/rest-api).
